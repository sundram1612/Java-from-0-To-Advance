          Q. Can we use Multiple Inheritance in Java ?
          --> Multiple Inheritance face problems when there exist methods with same signature in both the super classes.
              Due to such problems, Java does not support multiple inheritance directly but the similar concept can
              be achieved using interfaces.
              A class can implement multiple interfaces and extend a class at the same time.

              NOTE:-
              1. Interfaces in java is a bit like the class but with a significant difference.
              2. An Interface can only have method signature, fields, and default methods.
              3. The class implementing an inheritance needs to define the methods not necessarily the fields
              4. We can create a reference of interfaces but not the object.
              5. Interface methods are public by default.
