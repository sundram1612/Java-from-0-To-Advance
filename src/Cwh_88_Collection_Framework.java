/*
    Collection framework --> A Collection framework represents a group of object java collections provide classes and
                            interfaces for us to be able to write code quickly and efficiently.
    
    We need collections for efficient storage and better manipulation of data in Java.
    for ex- we use arrays to store integers but what if we want to 
             i) resize the array ?
            ii) insert an element in between ?
           iii) delete an element in array ?
            iv) apply certain operations to change this array ?

    Collections are available as classes and interfaces in java, Following are the commonly used collections in java.
      i) Set -> for distinct collection
     ii) Arraylist -> for variable size collection
    iii) Stack -> a LIFO data structure
     iv) HashMap -> for string key-value pairs
    
     Collection class is available in java.util package collection class also provides static methods for sorting, searching, etc.
