/*
   There are three types of errors in Java:-
   1) Syntax Error -> When compiler finds something wrong with our program it throws  a syntax error.
   2) Logical Error -> A logical error or a bug access when a program compiles and runs but does the wrong thing.
                     i> Message delivered wrongly
                    ii> Wrong time of chats being displayed.
                   iii> Incorrect redirects.
   3) Runtime Error -> Java may sometimes encounter an error while the program is running. These are also called Exceptions.
                       These are encountered due to circumstances like bad input and (or) resource constraints.
